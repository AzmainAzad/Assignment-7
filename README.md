Name of My Project: My Cricket Dream Team -- https://stellar-fenglisu-f6d878.netlify.app/


A brief Description: This is a webpage where anyone can build his or her dream Cricket team with 6 Players.


Technologies Used:
1. React.js 
2. Vite 
3. Tailwind CSS 
4. React Toastify 
5. Font Awesome 
6. JavaScript (ES6+) 
7. HTML5 & CSS3 
8. Netlify 



3 Key Features of my Project:

1. Player Selection System: Users can select up to a maximum of 6 players. When a player is selected, coins are deducted from the balance, and a success message is shown using Toastify.

2. Budget & Validation System: Players cannot be purchased unless the “Claim free credit” button is clicked. If the coins are insufficient or the user tries to select more than 6 players, a warning toast will appear.

3. Dynamic Player Management: If a player is removed from the selected player list, the balance is refunded. Users can toggle between viewing available players and selected players.
